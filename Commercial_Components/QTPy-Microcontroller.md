## QT Py Microcontroller form factor

The QT Py microcontroller form factor is a common form factor in the low-cost microcontrollers used by MMC, such as the Seeed Studio XIAO nrf52840 used in the LipSync, or the Adafruit SAMD21 QT Py used in the Forest Hub. It is also used in devices such as the Ivy Joystick where it is not soldered to a PCB but instead held in place with a snap fit.

Although it is most commonly attached to a PCB with headers, it is sometimes useful to know the primary dimensions for attaching it through snap fits, slide rails, or other methods. The primary dimensions are as follows.

- **Board Length:** The length of the board PCB.
- **Board Width:** The width of the board PCB.
- **Board Thickness:** The thickness of the board
- **USB C Port Protrusion:** The distance that the USB connector protrudes past the edge of the board PCB.
- **Base of Board to Center of USB Port:** This is the distance from the bottom of the board PCB to the centre of the USB C port connector. This distance is useful for determining the position of a knockout for the USB connector
