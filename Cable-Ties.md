# Cable Ties

Cable ties are typically used for strain relief on cables entering an enclosure or to otherwise attach cables and wires to a 3D print.

The cable ties used in most MMC projects require at least 3 mm of width, and 1 mm of thickness. When the cable tie runs along the exterior of the device, like the ones found at the bottom of the [Open Rocker Switch](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Open-Rocker-Switch), be aware that it will not bend a perfect 90 degrees and will either need a radiused bend or a slightly deeper channel to allow it to lie flush with the exterior of the device. If it is in the interior bottom of the device, a fillet along the bottom makes it easier to insert the cable without it getting stuck, as seen in the [Spruce joystick](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Spruce-Mini-Joystick)

## Dimensions

The primary dimensions and considerations of the part. 
* **Minimum Width:** The minimum width of the rectangle required for the cable tie to pass through. If using a circular passthrough, this is also the diameter of the circle.
* **Minimum Height:** The minimum height of the rectangle required for the cable tie to pass through.

| Minimum Thickness        | 1 mm  |

## Design Considerations

When designing parts that use this component, you need to keep in mind the following design considerations
* **Overhanging Holes:** Holes in unsupported overhanging material can print poorly and lead to parts not fitting. Refer to the Hydra Research Design Rules [section on overhanging holes](https://www.hydraresearch3d.com/design-rules#unsupported-holes) for how to design an overhanging hole that can print without support
* **Horizontally Printed Holes:** Holes in the wall of a print can sag when printed, while this isnâ€™t an issue for the threaded part of the hole, this can cause the passthrough hole to not pass through wall. When designing a hole meant to print horizontally, use a circumscribed octagon instead to eliminate the steep overhangs at the top of the circle. 
* **Layer Line Orientation:** When the cable tie is used to provide strain relief for a cable, consider the fact that it may be subject to a significant force. Make sure to orient the section that the cable tie is connected to in a way that the layer lines strengthen the section, not weaken it.
