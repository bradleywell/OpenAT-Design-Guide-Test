# T-Nut/Tee Nut

Tee nuts are off-the-shelf metal components that provide a way to add robust threads to a 3D printed part. Tee nuts are generally designed for use in wood and are intended to be hammered in from the opposite side of where the bolt or machine screw attaches.  
A ¼-20 UNC tee nut is used to add threads to a project, typically for mounting purposes.

This is one of the most complicated parts to add to a model, with a long list of dimensions required to make a suitable mounting feature. They can come in 3-, 4-, and 6- toothed versions, so the mounting hole has 12 slots to accommodate any version.

## Example Files

An example of the part dimensioned below is provided as an STL, a STEP, and a F3D file. Currently only the positive is provided, i.e. the part that was dimensioned, but there are plans to add a negative to allow the component to be imported into a design then added as a Boolean subtraction or addition, depending on if you are using the positive or negative.

## Dimensions

The following are the list of dimensions used in the T-Nut mounting feature.
* **Counterbore Radius:** The radius of the counterbore that sinks the flat surface of the T-Nut that the teeth and threaded shaft come out of.
* **Counterbore Depth:** The depth of the counterbore that sinks the flat surface of the T-Nut that the teeth and threaded shaft come out of.
* **Thread Radius:** The radius of the hole through the part that the threaded section of the T-Nut goes through.
* **Thread Depth:** The depth of the hole through the part that the threaded section of the T-Nut goes through.
* **Wall Thickness:** The thickness of the outer wall of the T-Nut fixture.
* **Chamfer Length:** The length of chamfer used to start the hole for the threaded shaft.
* **Tooth Spacing:** The distance between the centerline of the fixture and the furthest point of the tooth hole.
* **Tooth Width:** The width of the hole used to capture the teeth of the T-Nut.
* **Tooth Length:** The length of the hole used to capture the teeth of the T-Nut.
* **Tooth Depth:** The depth of the hole used to capture the teeth of the T-Nut.
* **Tooth Angle:** The angle between the teeth sloths on the fixture. This number comes from dividing the number of teeth (12) by the number of degrees in a circle (360).

## Design Considerations

When designing parts that use this component, you need to keep in mind the following design considerations
* **Overhanging Holes:** Holes in unsupported overhanging material can print poorly and lead to parts not fitting. Refer to the Hydra Research Design Rules [section on overhanging holes](https://www.hydraresearch3d.com/design-rules#unsupported-holes) for how to design an overhanging hole that can print without support
* **Horizontally Printed Holes:** Holes in the wall of a print can sag when printed, while this isn’t an issue for the threaded part of the hole, this can cause the passthrough hole to not pass through wall. When designing a hole meant to print horizontally, use a circumscribed octagon instead to eliminate the steep overhangs at the top of the circle.
